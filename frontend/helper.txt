components have folders for each type of part of the website (ie the navbar or a paragraph or images etc)
pages just import the components and make up the web page using components
app.jsx handles all of the URL routing and points a / to a page jsx file which then imports all components on it etc.


Dont be afraid to use GPT BUT understand what it is saying before going with it
